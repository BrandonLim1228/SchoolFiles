Wind Tunnel Dimensions 
- 800mm(high) * 1000mm(wide)

Major Airfoil Coordlength - try 400mm
- calculate blockage - 12%limit 
- - Chord length of 400mm resulted in 8.7% blockage at AOA = 90 deg
- - Chord length of 500mm results in 12% blockage at AOA = 60 deg
- - - Find thickness in centerline for varying root chord lengths
- - - Find thickness at 5% inset from leading edge for varying root chord lengths
